# BiSeNet V2

# Bilateral Network with Guided Aggregation for Real-time Semantic Segmentation

[Code](https://www.notion.so/Code-e1aace58b75d4a8ea73b64d5176031d7)

## Bilateral Network:

1. **Detail Branch**: to capture the spatial details with wide channels and shallow layers
2. **Semantic Branch**: to extract the categorical semantics with narrow channels and deep layers 

    → a large receptive field

    → lightweight with fewer channels and a fast-down sampling strategy

3. **Guided Aggregation Layer**: to merge both types of features
4. Booster Training Strategy with a series of auxiliary prediction heads (discarded in the inference phase)
- 72.6% mean IoU on the Cityscapes test set with the speed of 156 FPS on one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti card

## Core Concepts of BiSeNetV2

![BiSeNet%20V2%20d58f334e07724b26a1c00284d1b0447d/Untitled%202.png](BiSeNet%20V2%20d58f334e07724b26a1c00284d1b0447d/Untitled%202.png)

### 1. Detail Branch

### Why Wide Channels (?) and Shallow Layers (?)

- 1/8 of the original input
- Rich spatial details due to the high channel capacity.
- Because of the high channel capacity and the large spatial dimension, the residual structure (He et al., 2016) will increases the memory access cost (Ma et al., 2018). Therefore, this branch mainly obeys the philosophy of VGG nets (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) to stack the layers.

### 2. Semantic Branch

### Why Narrow Channels (?) and Deep Layers

- [ ]  Semantic Branch can be any lightweight convolutional model
- For large receptive field and efficient computation simultaneously
- Inspired by the philosophy of the lightweight recognition model, e.g., Xception, MobileNet, ShuffleNet

### Stem Block (Why?)

- (??) For efficient computation and effective feature expression ability
- Inspired by Inception V4
- Two different downsampling to shrink the feature representation
- Output feature of both branches are concatenated as the output

### Context Embedding Block

- For large receptive field to capture high-level semantics
- Inspired from Parsenet, Pyramid scene parsing network, Deeplab V3
- Global average pooling and residual connection to embed the global contextual information efficiently

### Gather(?)-and-Expansion(?) Layer  (vs Inverted Bottleneck)

- Taking advantage of the benefit of depth-wise convolution
1. 3 × 3 convolution to gather local feature response and expand to higher-dimensional space (?)
2. 3 × 3 depth-wise convolution performed independently over each individual output channel of the expansion layer
3. 1×1 convolution as the projection layer to project the output of depth-wise convolution into a low channel capacity space. 
- (?) When the stride = 2, two 3×3 depth-wise convolutions on the main path and a 3 × 3 separable convolution as the shortcut.
- Recent works (Tan et al., 2019; Howard et al., 2019) adopt 5 × 5 separable convolution heavily to enlarge the receptive field, which has fewer FLOPS than two 3 × 3 separable convolution in some conditions. In this layer, we replace the 5 × 5 depth-wise convolution in the separable convolution with two 3 × 3 depth-wise convolution, which has fewer FLOPS and the same receptive field.
- (Vs inverted bottleneck in MobileNetv2), the GE Layer has one more 3×3 convolution. However, this layer is also friendly to the computation cost and memory access cost (Ma et al., 2018; Sandler et al., 2018), because the 3 × 3 convolution is specially optimized in the CUDNN library (Chetlur et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2018). Meanwhile, because of this layer, the GE Layer has higher feature expression ability than the inverted bottleneck.

## Bilateral Guided Aggregation

- There are some different manners to merge two types of feature response, i.e., element-wise summation and concatenation. However, the outputs of both branches have different levels of feature representation.

## Booster Training Strategy

- Auxiliary segmentation head to different positions of the Semantic Branch.
- (Why also not in Detail Branch?)

## Experimental Results

### Cityscapes

- training, validation and test sets, with 2, 975, 500 and 1, 525 images
- 30 classes, 19 of which are used for semantic segmentation task.
- challenging for the real-time ← high resolution of 2, 048 × 1, 024.
